Hi! I'm Daniel Dulaney, and I'm an engineer working on [computer vision systems](https://www.vitronic.com/en-us/logistics) for sorting mail, but with interests in networking, optimization, and systems programming. I'm currently based in Louisville, but have lived in Washington DC and Pittsburgh.

I'm always available by [email](mailto:dulaney.daniel@gmail.com).
